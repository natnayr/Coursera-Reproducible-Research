Evidence-Based Data Analysis

Replication Summary
- Focus on validity of scientific claim
- Is this claim true?
- The ultimate standard for strengtening scientific evidence
- New investigators, data, analytical methods, labs, instruments
- Particularly important in studies that impact broad policy or regulatory decisions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reproducibility Summary
- Focus on validility of data analysis
- Can we trust this analysis?
- Argueably a minimum standard for scientific study
- New investigators, same data, same methods
- Important when replication is impossible for one-off data (e.g. polution index)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Background and Underlying Treads

- Studies cannot be replicated, no time or money
- Technology is increasing data collection, BIG DATA
- Existing databases can be merged to become bigger databases
- Computing power allows more sophisticated analysis, even on "small" data
- For every field "X" there is a "Computational X"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Results?
- Basic analysis are difficult to describe
- Heavy computational requirements are made on people without training in
stats or computing
- Error are easily introduced
- Knowledge transfer is inhibited
- Results are difficult to replicate or reproduce
- Complicated analyses cannot be trusted.

What is Reproducible Research?
- Author, Scientific Questions -> Protocol -> Nature -> Measure
Followed to Domain of Analytic Data -> Computational Results
	-> Figures, Tablets, Numerical Summaries
